ANGULAR

Basic Building blocks

1)modules -To import 3rd party modules(root modules)
2)components - To create HTML , CSS and ts files


Basic Commands

1)ng new project_name - To create a new project
2)ng g c component_name  - To create a new component
3) ng serve --open - To run angular file



Basic concepts

1) Data Binding  -Share data between components

ts file if component 
and html is view

data sharing is between componemt and view

    Two types of data sharing
       a)One way data binding (1 direction)
            The one way data binding between component to view or view to component

               a.1)component to view (ts-->html)
                     i)string interpolation (1 direction ) - {{expression}}  [(<h6>{{aim}}</h6> in login.component.html  ]

                    ii) property binding  ([placeholder]="account"  in login.component.html )

                a.2)view to component  (html-->ts)
                     i)Event binding (1 direction)-(event_name)="function_name()";
                           (login()created in login component.ts and create a (click) fuction in button in  login.component.html)

                     ii) Event binding using $event (event_name)="fuction_name($event_name)";
                     iii) Event binding using template referenceing variable - #variable_name  
                           
        b) Two way data binding (2 direction - at a time data send to  html->ts and ts->html)    

                 i)ngModel -  formModule  (for using ngModelwe need formModule and it contain in app.module.ts)
                               [(ngModel)]="propert_name"  

                 ii)angular routing - To set path for a component  (we set the path in  app-routing.module.ts file and it write inside the    const routes: Routes = [];)
                           syntax:
                                 {
                                    path : "value",component:class_name
                                 }                 
                            Example: Login (login is main page so it need only '' in path)

                                {
                                    path:'',component:LoginComponent
                                },

                iii)Dependancy injection -To share data between two dependent classes
                             eg: Router class -navigateByaurl is used to navigete the component

                iv)Angular services  - to hold redundant data   
                     ng g s service_name    (desktopile folderin bank app ->src ->app->open terminal athinagathu ee co) 

                 v)Angular directives   -  To manipulate DOM

                       a) Component Directives(array)
                       b) Structural Directives(table)   
                            1) *ngFor 

                 vi) Angular Forms

                       a)Template Driven Forms   (First design HTML page  and cant do validations )
                       b)Model Driven Forms    (First design Model in ts file . It have easy validation methods)
                             -Advanced validation

                             1)Reactive Forms  -
                                 Reactive forms include
                                 a)form group
                                 b)form array 
                                 c)form control

                                 We can directly add validations via importing reactive form module
